# EmoteCraft: Affect-Responsive Dialogue System for Game Characters

## 📖 1. Introduction

This project proposes the development of an **Affect-Responsive Dialogue System** for game characters, inspired by the relationship between dialogue, emotional state, and character portrayal as seen in the provided example. The system aims to enable NPCs to dynamically alter their dialogue—and optionally facial expressions or behavior—based on an analyzed emotional state. This creates more immersive and believable interactions.

> **Example Reference**: A character resembling Emily from *Stardew Valley* says,  
> *“你让我心都碎了……我不能再和你说话了。”*  
> *(“you've broken my heart...I can't talk to you anymore.”)*  
>  
> **Mood Analysis**: The dialogue conveys strong negative emotion, reflecting emotional pain and disappointment. Terms like "心都碎了" ("heartbroken") express sadness and betrayal, while the refusal to continue the conversation suggests a state of anger, despair, and emotional withdrawal.

## 🎯 2. Project Goals

- **Develop a Mood Analysis Module**  
  Analyze text-based dialogue to classify it into emotional tones (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disappointment).

- **Create a Dynamic Dialogue Generation Engine**  
  Generate or select dialogue responses based on the current emotional state and interaction context.

- **Integrate with Character Visuals** 
  Modify character portraits or sprites to reflect emotions visually.

- **Build a Proof of Concept**  
  Create a prototype showing a character whose mood and dialogue change dynamically in response to interaction triggers.
