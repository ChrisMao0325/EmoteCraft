## üöÄ What's New in EmoteCraft?
- **AI-Driven Emotional Portraits**: Automatically generate character portraits that reflect the emotion in dialogue.
- **Modern Web Interface**: User-friendly, responsive UI for dialogue browsing and portrait generation.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from multiple AI models (pixel, cartoon, realistic, etc.) for different art styles.

## üìñ Introduction
![99dd92821a47fa526faf9a869093f28](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4488b6ca-d984-4dd3-8780-748e9aab9721)
This project proposes the development of an **Affect-Responsive Dialogue System** for game characters, inspired by the relationship between dialogue, emotional state, and character portrayal as seen in the provided example. The system aims to enable NPCs to dynamically alter their dialogue‚Äîand optionally facial expressions or behavior‚Äîbased on an analyzed emotional state. This creates more immersive and believable interactions.

> **Example Reference**: A character resembling Emily from *Stardew Valley* says,  
> *"‰Ω†ËÆ©ÊàëÂøÉÈÉΩÁ¢é‰∫Ü‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Êàë‰∏çËÉΩÂÜçÂíå‰Ω†ËØ¥ËØù‰∫Ü„ÄÇ"*  
> *(‚Äúyou've broken my heart...I can't talk to you anymore.‚Äù)*  
>  
> **Mood Analysis**: The dialogue conveys strong negative emotion, reflecting emotional pain and disappointment. Terms like "ÂøÉÈÉΩÁ¢é‰∫Ü" ("heartbroken") express sadness and betrayal, while the refusal to continue the conversation suggests a state of anger, despair, and emotional withdrawal.

### How to Run
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash

   ```
2. **Prepare your data**:
   - Place dialogue JSON files in `Data/dialogue/Chinese/`.
   - Place character avatars in `input3/`.
   - Place your background image in `static/images/stardew_bg.png`.

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. **Open your browser** and visit `http://localhost:5000`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è LLM API Configuration
To enable AI prompt generation, you need to configure your LLM (Large Language Model) API credentials. Set the following environment variables before running the app:

- `LLM_API_BASE` ‚Äî The base URL of your LLM API (e.g., OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
- `LLM_API_KEY` ‚Äî Your API key/token
- `LLM_MODEL_NAME` ‚Äî The model name to use (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `deepseek-chat`)

**Example (Linux/macOS):**
```bash
export LLM_API_BASE="https://api.openai.com/v1"
export LLM_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxx"
export LLM_MODEL_NAME="gpt-3.5-turbo"
```

**Example (Windows CMD):**
```cmd
set LLM_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
set LLM_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxx
set LLM_MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo
```
